- Twitter Developer Account (for Twitter API access)
- Internet connection

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nrk8286/osint-app.git
cd osint-app
```

### 2. Create Virtual Environment (Recommended)

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure API Keys

#### Twitter API Setup

1. Go to [Twitter Developer Portal](https://developer.twitter.com/)
2. Create a new project and app
3. Generate your API credentials:
   - API Key
   - API Secret
   - Access Token
   - Access Token Secret
   - Bearer Token

#### Environment Configuration

1. Copy the example environment file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Edit `.env` and add your Twitter API credentials:
   ```
   TWITTER_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key
   TWITTER_API_SECRET=your_actual_api_secret
   TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_actual_access_token
   TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=your_actual_access_token_secret
   TWITTER_BEARER_TOKEN=your_actual_bearer_token
   ```

**Note**: Keep your `.env` file secure and never commit it to version control (it's already in `.gitignore`).

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Run the monitor with a keyword:

```bash
python osint_monitor.py "your keyword"
```

Or run interactively:

```bash
python osint_monitor.py
# Enter keyword when prompted
```

### Example

```bash
python osint_monitor.py "artificial intelligence"
```

This will:
1. Search Google for "artificial intelligence"
2. Search Twitter for recent tweets mentioning "artificial intelligence"
3. (Optional) Scrape configured websites for mentions
4. Save all results to a timestamped CSV file (e.g., `mentions_20231029_143022.csv`)

### Customizing Web Scraping

To add custom websites to scrape, edit the `scrape_urls` list in `osint_monitor.py`:

```python
scrape_urls = [
    'https://example.com',
    'https://news.ycombacker.com',
    # Add more URLs here
]
```

## Output

The application generates a CSV file with the following columns:

- **source**: Platform where mention was found (Google, Twitter, Web Scraping)
- **keyword**: The searched keyword
- **url**: Link to the mention
- **title**: Title or description of the mention
- **timestamp**: When the mention was collected
- **content**: Actual content of the mention (if available)

Example output filename: `mentions_20231029_143022.csv`

## Dependencies

- **googlesearch-python**: For Google search integration
- **tweepy**: Twitter API client
- **requests**: HTTP library for web scraping
- **beautifulsoup4**: HTML parsing for web scraping
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and CSV export
- **python-dotenv**: Environment variable management

## Troubleshooting

### Google Search Issues

If you encounter rate limiting or blocking from Google:
- Reduce the number of results requested
- Increase sleep intervals between requests
- Use Google's Custom Search API for production use

### Twitter API Issues

Common issues:
- **Authentication Error**: Check your credentials in `.env`
- **Rate Limit**: Twitter has rate limits; wait before making more requests
- **Insufficient Access**: Ensure your Twitter Developer account has appropriate access level

### Web Scraping Issues

- Some websites may block automated scraping
- Always check and respect `robots.txt`
- Consider using official APIs when available

## Limitations

- **Google Search**: Uses unofficial API, may have rate limits
- **Twitter API**: Free tier has limited requests and 7-day search history
- **Web Scraping**: Some sites actively block scraping; respect their policies
